             -  Information      o  Option

High importance:

[ ] Compound literals
[ ] Anonymous:
    [ ] Unions
    [ ] Structs
    [ ] Structs in unions
[ ] const
[-] char
[ ] Review type compatibility
[ ] Numeric type coercion: widening & narrowing
[ ] Type completeness
[-] Varargs
[-] enum
[ ] extern
[ ] argc & argv passing
[ ] continue
[-] static
    [ ] Function linkage
    [ ] Disallow all others?
[ ] Disallow global variables
[ ] Modules
    [ ] Separated namespaces
    [ ] Different dialect?
        - No impls

Medium:

[-] Typedef

Low:

[ ] main conformance
[ ] % /
[ ] Pretty printing control by command line
[ ] string
[ ] New IR
    - Expression only (to start withw)
[ ] Designated initializers in compound literals



Other issues:

[ ] Add symbol size back to debug output

Lexer:

[ ] Lexing of pp
[ ] More on char and str lexing

Parser:

[ ] Param name clash
[ ] Fix bop location thingy (astCreateBOP(o, l))
[-] Symbol shadowing
[ ] Get tokenMatch to guess whether to skip based on similarity of tokens
[ ] Line that starts with undeclared ident... assume decl?
[ ] Complain about keywords as idents
[ ] Disallow initializations inside regular expressions

Semantic analyzer:

[ ] Check constness of array sizes, enum values etc
[ ] Array size detection (basic x[] = {...})
[ ] Do analyzerArrayLiteral lits properly
[ ] Check that fn impl and var init are semantically valid
[ ] Move sym checking code from analyzerDecl to analyzerDeclIdentLiteral?
    Why not?
[-] Make sure prototypes and implementation match exactly (static)
[ ] Empty decl warning?

Emitter:

[ ] Get rid of global state in registers and labels
[ ] Clean up value moving code
[ ] Free operands before use, so can do things like:
      mov rbx, dword ptr [rbp+16]
      mov _rbx_, dword ptr [rbx+8]
[ ] Get rid of &regs[] use outside reg.c
    - Make stack operations
    - Differentiate between top and base operands
[ ] Short circuit ops optimization
    - If flag condition is the same, just return flags :D
      This chains well
[ ] Extra layer between emitter and assembly?
    - Expand operand?
    - Maybe: have a layer that takes expressions and an operation,
      sends them off to emitterValue, handles operands and reg
      placement.
