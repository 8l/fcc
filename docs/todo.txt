[ ] Self hosting
    [ ] Discrepancies between GCC and FCC:
        - Ptr decl binding: non issue
        - struct and union decl syntax & semantics
        - Module system
        - Sequence points? No, seems to be the same

[-] Type system
    - By val -> By ref (grr)
    - Wrap types in modifiers: ptr, array, fn
    - Match-all class for error handling
[ ] Operator table

[-] enum
[-] Block scope
[ ] Casts
    - (type) value
    - Differentiate between this and (value) by symbol lookup

[-] Const correctness
[-] Make sure prototypes and implementation match exactly (static)
[ ] Use a cond field of
[ ] Do analyzerArrayLiteral lits properly
[ ] File names in error messages
[ ] Fix type compatibility
    - Type coercion needed (remember: bool -> int)
[ ] Fix bop location thingy (astCreateBOP(o, l))
[ ] Fix lvalue error messages
[ ] Check constness of array sizes, enum values etc
[ ] Move type assignment stuff to analyzer? Could solve some of the above
[ ] Filext

[ ] Abysmal error recovery
[ ] AST is not abstract
[ ] AST field reuse is weird and unclear
[x] Parser/semantics merged => overly complex
    - When in doubt, reject *semantically*
      This means the parser fucks up less.
[ ] Dealing with operands in the emitter is cumbersome
[ ] Arch specifics are a bit magic value-y
[-] Type system overly simple
[-] Lack of comments, esp. interface documentation
[ ] Assumption of operand class permutations required
[ ] Unit tests
